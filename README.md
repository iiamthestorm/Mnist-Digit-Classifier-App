# Digit Classifier App

## What is this App?  
This app is a mobile handwritten digit image classifier based on the **MNIST dataset**. It offers **two distinct features** for classifying images, one **without data augmentation** and the other **with data augmentation**. This app mostly just for researching purposes. Don't expect the UI will be awesome HEHE.

## What is inside of this Repo?
**This Repo contains** the source code, assets, and resources needed to build and run the app. You can also Download the apk yourself.
